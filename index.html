        <h2>Who are we</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This page is created and run by computer science students at UNC Charlotte</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why</h2>
        <div>
            <p>In our own experience, trying to repair electronics is harder than it should be. We would like to see more user oriented
            design. By this we mean that products should be designed with the users needs in mind and one of the most important
            of those needs is device repairability which has been lacking in recent generations of devices. Our goal is to educate users
            on the hardware of their phones and what it takes to repair them and also how they can get involved with the right to repair movement.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What to expect</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Within this site you'll find various internal and external resources for learning about the right to repair movement and how
            to get involved. We also have an image gallery where users can post their own repair images and content to show each other.
            We have also taken the time to collect a few repair manuals from trusted sources so that you can repair your own devices. Finally
            we have created an interactive resource for learning the basics about the parts that make up an average cellphone.</p>
